2,All counts in census tabulations are subjected to a process called random rounding. Random rounding transforms all raw counts to random rounded counts. This reduces the possibility of identifying individuals within the tabulations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"For additional information, please refer to the Dictionary, Census of Population, 2016.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"Health regions are administrative areas defined by provincial ministries of health according to provincial legislation. The health regions presented in this table are based on boundaries and names in effect as of 2017. For complete Canadian coverage, each northern territory represents a health region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"The global non-response rate (GNR) is an important measure of census data quality. It combines total non-response (households) and partial non-response (questions). This measure is used for the 2016 Census, as it was for the 2011 and 2006 censuses. The GNR is calculated for dissemination of the short-form questionnaire counts and long-form questionnaire estimates. For the long-form census questionnaire, the GNR is weighted to take sampling into account. A lower GNR indicates a lower risk of non-response bias and, as a result, a lower risk of inaccuracy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Statistics Canada is committed to protect the privacy of all Canadians and the confidentiality of the data they provide to us. As part of this commitment, some population counts of geographic areas are adjusted in order to ensure confidentiality.  The adjustment to counts of the total population for any dissemination block is controlled to ensure that the population counts for dissemination areas will always be within 5 of the actual values. The adjustment has no impact on the population counts of census divisions and large census subdivisions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"A population centre (POPCTR) has a population of at least 1,000 and a population density of 400 persons or more per square kilometre, based on population counts from the current Census of Population. All areas outside population centres are classified as rural areas.  Taken together, population centres and rural areas cover all of Canada. Population centres are classified into three groups, depending on the size of their population: small population centres, with a population between 1,000 and 29,999 medium population centres, with a population between 30,000 and 99,999 large urban population centres, with a population of 100,000 or more. Population centre population includes all population living in the cores, secondary cores and fringes of census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and census agglomerations (CAs), as well as the population living in population centres outside CMAs and CAs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"Rural areas (RAs) include all territory lying outside population centres (POPCTRs). Taken together, population centres and rural areas cover all of Canada.  Rural population includes all population living in rural areas of census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and census agglomerations (CAs), as well as population living in rural areas outside CMAs and CAs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,Population density is the number of persons per square kilometre.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
